**Last Updated:** 07/09/2023

Welcome to SNS Manager. We prioritize your privacy and have established this Privacy Policy to explain how we handle user data. Given the nature of our mobile application, the Privacy Policy is notably straightforward: We don't collect or store any of your personal data.

### 2. Third-party services

Our app might use third-party services (APIs) that have their own privacy policies. We cannot guarantee that these services do not collect information about you. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services if you have concerns.
