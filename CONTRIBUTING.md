Welcome, future SNS Manager contributor! We're thrilled to have you here.

Before you start contributing, here are a few guidelines to make the process smoother for everyone involved.

## Getting Started 👩‍💻👨‍💻

1. **Fork the repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository that you can modify without affecting the original code.

2. **Clone the repository:** After forking, clone the repository to your local machine to start making changes.

## Making Changes 🛠️

1. **Create a new branch:** Always make changes in a new branch, not in the master branch. Name the branch something relevant to the changes you're making.

2. **Make your changes:** Make the changes you think would improve the project. This could be anything from fixing a bug to adding a new feature.

3. **Test your changes:** Before you submit your changes, make sure they don't break the app. Run your changes on your device/emulator and ensure everything works as expected.

## Submitting Changes 📬

1. **Commit your changes:** After making and testing your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message. This helps us understand what the changes do.

2. **Push your changes:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

3. **Open a pull request:** Finally, open a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made, why you've made them, and any other information that might be helpful.

## Code of Conduct 📜

We're dedicated to maintaining a welcoming and productive community. Please be respectful and considerate of others. Any form of harassment or offensive behavior is unacceptable.
