<h2 align="center">Development and Build Commands 💻</h2>
<br />

This section introduces commands to expedite the development and building processes of our React Native project for web and xNFT platforms, enhancing the wallet connection experience.

### Development

For development, you can initiate the server with `yarn dev:xnft` for the xNFT target and `yarn dev:web` for the web target.

### Building

To transition to a production-ready build, use `yarn build:xnft` for the xNFT target and `yarn build:web` for the web target.

### Wallet Connection

Both development and build configurations accommodate seamless wallet connection for web and xNFT platforms. Thus, these commands facilitate a unified and efficient experience of developing and building applications for different targets. Please report issues or suggestions through an issue or a pull request.
